CommandLineInterface
####################

Writing CLI is **NOT** funny. Especially with all the
argument parsing and shit. This is why this module exists.

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

    from command_line_interface import CommandLineInterface, Argument

    cli = CommandLineInterface()
    users = ["John Doe", "Dick Head"]

    @cli.endpoint(Argument('user', help='username to add'))
    def do_user_add(args):
        users.append(args.user)
        print users

    @cli.endpoint()
    def do_user_list(args):
        print users

        cli.parse()

As shown in the ``example.py`` file.

You can run it like:

.. code:: bash

    $ ./exemple.py user add
    usage: exemple.py user add [-h] user
    exemple.py user add: error: too few arguments
    $ ./exemple.py user add "foo bar"
    ['John Doe', 'Dick Head', 'foo bar']


Simple as that :)

Documentation
=============

Some more documentation is comming, stay tuned.

Using the module
----------------

You have to import the components you need, which for now are:

* ``CommandLineInterface``
* ``Argument``
* ``ExclusiveGroup``

Then instanciate a ``CommandLineInterface``:

.. code:: python

    cli = CommandLineInterface()


Then decorate your endpoint as follows:

.. code:: python

    @cli.endpoint(
        Argument('argument', help="some help"), # positional arg
        Argument('--user', '-u') # optional argument
    )
    def do_something(args):
        print args # args is a argparse.Namespace object

You can add as many arguments as you wish, the parameters
have to follow the ``argparse.add_argument`` syntax. Note
that your function's name must be prefixed with ``do_`` in
order for the parsing to work. It will just break the
name of the function into a "tree" where each ``_``-delimited
word will be a leaf. So you can add more methods to your
'user' endpoint.

Finally to parse something, just call:

.. code:: python

    cli.parse()

This will parse arguments from ``sys.argv``. Alternatively,
you may parse an arbitrary string:

.. code:: python

    cli.parse("some string")

I told you it does not have to be hard!
